## Why?
[YNAB (You Need A Budget)](https://www.youneedabudget.com) is a great budgeting tool but it's not free.
This project aims to create a full featured multi-platform application with features similar to the [budgeting 
method of YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/the-four-rules/) without having a backend.

## Features
 - Use cloud storages like Dropbox or Google Drive for syncing mechanism
 - Have multiple devices sync to a shared budget

## Platforms
 - iOS - main budgeting tool
 - watchOS - get reminders for bills or expected income, check remaining amount for pinned category budgets
 - tvOS - display graphs and statistics
 - macOS - budgeting tool for macOS, (still, the main focus is iOS, we want the budgeting to be always mobile)
 
## PS
 - This project is for learning best practices like continuous integration
   with unit tests.
