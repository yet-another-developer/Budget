# Budget

## Why?
[YNAB (You Need A Budget)](https://www.youneedabudget.com) is a great budgeting tool but it's not free.
This project aims to create a full featured mobile only application with features similar to the [budgeting 
method of YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/the-four-rules/) without having a backend.

## Features
 - Use cloud storages like Dropbox or Google Drive for syncing mechanism
 - Have multiple devices sync to a shared budget
 
## PS
 - This project is for learning best practices like continuous integration
   with unit tests.
